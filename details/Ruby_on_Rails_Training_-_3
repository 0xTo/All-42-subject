Ruby on Rails Training - 3
Final
Summary: In order to make your pages more fun and the UX more pleasant, you need
to work on the client side, but it doesn’t know Ruby. This is why you will have to use
JavaScript.
The ﬁrst part of the day will aim to make the CRUD more dynamic with some AJAX. The
second part will be about multi-user real time with WebSockets provided through
ActionCable (a new feature in Rails 5).
