IRC
Internet Relay Chat
Summary: The goal of this project is to make you write your own IRC server. To do
so, you will test your work with a real IRC client. Internet is ruled by solid and
standards protocols that allow a strong interaction between every connected computer.
Itâ€™s always good to know about it.
