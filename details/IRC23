IRC
Internet Relay Chat
Summary: The goal of this project is to make you write your own IRC server. To do
so, you will follow the real IRC RFC and test your work with real IRC clients. Internet
is ruled by solid and standards protocols that allow a strong interaction between every
connected computer. Itâ€™s always good to know about it.
